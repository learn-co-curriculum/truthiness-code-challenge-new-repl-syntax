# Truthiness Code Challenge

## Objectives

1. Strengthen your understanding of truthiness in Ruby
2. Practice using boolean and comparison operators


%%%

### Code Challenge I

Take a look at the code below. We have defined a method, `returning_true` that uses a comparison operator, the `<` (less than) to compare the number 14 to...nothing. Fill out the necessary portion of the code so that the method will return `true`. Then, call the method.

~~~ruby

def returning_true
	14 < #your solution here
end

# DO NOT touch the following line!

returning_true

~~~solution

def returning_true
	14 < 20
end

returning_true

~~~validation

assert_true(response)

~~~

### Code Challanege II

Here we have a method, `returning_false` that uses both comparison and boolean operators. Fill out the remainder of the method so that it returns false. Then, call the method.


~~~ruby

def returning_false
	7 > 4 && 100 < #your solution here
end

#DO NOT touch the following line!

returning_false

~~~solution

def returning_false
	7 > 4 && 100 < 99
end

returning_false

~~~validation

assert_false(response)

~~~

### Code Challenge III

Take a look at the method `using_truthiness` below. Fill out the missing portion so that the method returns false. Then, call the method.

~~~ruby

def using_truthiness
	7 > 8 || #your solution here
end

#Do NOT touch the following line!

using_truthiness

~~~solution

def using_truthiness
	7 > 8 || 8 < 7
end

using_truthiness

~~~validation

assert_equal(response, false)
